# Community spotlight

Open-source **projects, harnesses, and benchmarks** that implement or evaluate self-evolving agents — contributed and reviewed by the community.

> Papers live in [README.md](README.md). **This file is for runnable repos, tools, and eval stacks.**  
> Add yours via [issue template](https://github.com/sukoji/awesome-self-evolving-agents/issues/new/choose) or PR (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#community-projects)).

## Submission checklist

1. Repo is **public** and **maintained** (commit in the last ~6 months, or tagged release).
2. Clearly implements or evaluates **self-evolution** (not a static agent framework with no learning loop).
3. One **neutral** sentence — what it does, not marketing copy.
4. Pick the primary **pathway** tag.
5. Open a PR editing this file **or** use the [Suggest a project](https://github.com/sukoji/awesome-self-evolving-agents/issues/new?template=suggest-project.yml) issue.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full review rubric.
