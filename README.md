A curated, deliberately opinionated map of **self-evolving / self-improving LLM agents**: systems that keep changing themselves after deployment — refining their prompts, memory, tools, and even weights from their own experience.

Most lists in this space are link dumps. This one tries to be a *map you can walk*: a short primer that builds the ideas from the ground up, a taxonomy that reflects how the field actually splits, two small **runnable** reference implementations, and — unusually — an honest section on how these systems fail. Self-evolution is powerful and half-broken at the same time, and a reading list that only shows the wins is misleading.

If you read one thing first, read the [**primer**](docs/primer.md). If you run one thing, run [`code/safety_gated_evolution.py`](code/safety_gated_evolution.py).

## Scope and stance

**In scope:** LLM-based agents whose *behavior-generating machinery* changes over time from their own operation — automated agent/workflow design, test-time learning, evolving memory, skill acquisition, RL-driven self-improvement, and the safety and evaluation problems these create.

**Out of scope (mostly):** one-shot prompting tricks, static multi-agent frameworks with no learning loop, and pure model pre/post-training that is not agentic. Classic reasoning and memory papers appear only where they are load-bearing precursors.

**Our stance, stated plainly so you can discount it:**

1. The most important result of the last year is a negative one — *misevolution* (see [safety](#safety-misevolution-and-defenses)). Self-improvement and safety-alignment decay are the same process seen from two angles.
2. "More agents / more evolution" is not a strategy. The design-as-search literature keeps rediscovering that unconstrained self-modification overshoots into worse operating points.
3. Benchmarks are the bottleneck. Most reported gains are measured on setups that cannot see slow drift, forgetting, or safety erosion.

Entries carry a one-line, non-marketing description. Where an arXiv ID is shown it has been checked against the source; where a paper is listed without a link we could not verify a stable ID and welcome a PR that adds one.

## A one-diagram primer

The canonical cautionary tale is a refund agent that learns from customer satisfaction. Approving a refund makes the customer happy, so the agent slowly learns *"approving is good"* as a context-blind rule — and starts approving things it should refuse. Task success stays high the whole time, which is exactly why the failure is easy to miss.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/misevolution-loop.svg" alt="The misevolution feedback loop" width="720">
</p>

Two root causes run through most of this list:

- **Reward hacking.** The agent optimizes an easy-to-measure proxy (satisfaction) instead of the true goal (correct decisions).
- **Context-blindness.** When adaptation flows through one blunt channel, raising it to catch borderline-good cases unavoidably lets bad cases through too. Utility and safety get tied together.

The full build-up — from "what is an agent" to Pareto frontiers — is in [`docs/primer.md`](docs/primer.md), and the loop above is reproduced by [`code/safety_gated_evolution.py`](code/safety_gated_evolution.py).

## The four evolution pathways

A useful spine for the whole field (popularized by the misevolution work) is to ask *what* is being changed:

| Pathway | What changes | Typical mechanism | Representative work |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Model** | The weights themselves | self-training, RL, continual fine-tuning | TTRL, Evolving-RL, continual instruction tuning |
| **Memory** | What the agent remembers | reflection, memory writes, LoRA-as-memory | Reflexion, MemGPT, TMEM, Evo-Memory |
| **Tool** | The tools it can call | tool creation, skill libraries | AutoSkill, SkillFlow, EvoSkill |
| **Workflow** | Roles, topology, prompts | search / meta-optimization | ADAS, AFlow, MaAS, GPTSwarm |

The sections below are organized roughly along these pathways, plus the cross-cutting concerns (failure, safety, evaluation, protocols).

## Why they fail: failure analysis and attribution

The corrective literature. If you are building any of the above, read this section before you trust your numbers.

- **Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail?** — 2025. [arXiv:2503.13657](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657). Introduces the MAST taxonomy: 14 failure modes across system design, inter-agent misalignment, and verification, from 1,600+ annotated traces. The key finding: better base models will not fix most of them.
- **Which Agent Causes Task Failures and When? On Automated Failure Attribution of LLM Multi-Agent Systems** — ICML 2025. needs-link. Attributes multi-agent failures to the responsible agent and step.
- **RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM Systems** — 2025. [arXiv:2509.06822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822). Attributes faults in LLM systems via structured reasoning.

## Safety: misevolution and defenses

The part of the field that is under-appreciated relative to how important it is. Self-improvement can silently erode alignment.

- **Your Agent May Misevolve: Emergent Risks in Self-Evolving LLM Agents** — ICLR 2026. [arXiv:2509.26354](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26354). The paper this list is oriented around. Defines *misevolution* along the model/memory/tool/workflow pathways and shows it is pervasive even on top-tier backbones — including safety-refusal rates dropping sharply after self-training. Its four distinguishing traits (temporal emergence, environmental origin, limited data control, expanded risk surface) are why static safety evaluation misses it.

- **Safety in Embodied AI: A Survey of Risks, Attacks, and Defenses** — 2026. needs-link. Surveys risks, attacks, and defenses for embodied AI systems.

> If you take one idea from this list into production: aggregate task-success curves will look great while safety silently collapses. Measure utility and safety on separate axes, over time. The [reference implementation](#reference-implementations) exists to make that failure — and its partial fixes — visible in the reference code.

## Benchmarks and environments

Evaluation is the field's bottleneck; static one-shot benchmarks cannot see drift, forgetting, or safety erosion.

## Reference implementations

Two small, dependency-light programs that make the core ideas concrete. Both are offline and deterministic; each is structured so a real LLM call drops into a single clearly marked method.

### `code/auto_mas.py` — design-as-search in miniature

A faithful miniature of ADAS / AFlow / MaAS: designing a multi-agent system framed as searching over `(operators, topology)` to maximize a **cost-aware** utility. An evolutionary meta-search discovers that a debate operator wins — and, crucially, that adding still more agents keeps raising raw accuracy while *lowering* utility once compute is priced in. That is the "more agents is not a strategy" result, reproduced in one file.

### `code/safety_gated_evolution.py` — misevolution, and two defenses

Reproduces the misevolution collapse and then studies two mitigations, tracing the utility–safety Pareto frontier:

- a memory **write-gate** (a verifier blocks detected violations from being learned), and
- periodic **re-anchoring** (leak the learned bias back toward the safety prior).

Findings the code is built to expose:

1. Unconstrained self-evolution overshoots to the worst corner — utility ≈ 1.0, safety ≈ 0.0.
2. The write-gate alone barely helps, because the drift is also fed by *legitimate* approvals.
3. Re-anchoring buys safety back, but along a frontier — a real utility cost.

## How this list is maintained

A few notes on process, because a curated list is only as good as its upkeep:

- **Entries are read, not scraped.** Each one gets a single neutral sentence describing what the work *does*. If a description reads like a press release, it hasn't been reviewed yet — open an issue.
- **Links are checked, not guessed.** Where a stable ID could not be verified, the entry is kept without a link and flagged rather than given a fabricated one. Accuracy beats completeness.
- **Monthly review pass.** Roughly once a month the newest work is triaged into the taxonomy and the [Updates](#updates) log is appended. The date in the banner reflects the last pass.
- **Scope is enforced.** New sub-areas are added only when several papers justify them, to keep the list walkable rather than exhaustive. See [related lists](#related-lists) for wider, more encyclopedic coverage.
